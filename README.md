Just a simple offline Poker Game. You can cusomise how many opponents you play against (1-3). Each computer will make a completely random/uneducated choice so it is all luck

KNOWN BUGS:
The log shows "Computer: win" even if the player wins
The dealer doesn't change, so the blinds are always paid by the same players each round
